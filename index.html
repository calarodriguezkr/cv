        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>I love art since i was a kid. Later that became an interest in design. Then i discovered programming. So currently i´m learning how it all mixes up with the help of Angela Yu and her course "<a class="link"href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">The Complete 2021 Web Developer Bootcamp</a>".</p>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>My love and passion for cooking came later in life, specially when i decided to go vegan and had to learn to cook in a total different way than i used to. The most wonderful part was getting to know the culinary customs from all around the world to get inspired. I´m from Argentina and here we don´t have a very rich variety of flavour in our cuisine, so trying all sorts of new things required some courage and adaptation. But i´m so happy i did it! As Jacques Pépin said “Cooking is the art of adjustment”. And i belive that applies to everything in life.</p>

        <h3>Learning New Things</h3>
        <p>Recently i've been making peaces with my keen on learning and creative side. I'm making up for the practice lost in my English skills, and i'm slowly learning Korean in my free time. Sometimes the process gets really slow due to other activities, but i'm here for the ride and so far it's been very enjoyable. I'm also working on my creative side by taking time to read everyday and write as often as i can. They say art is the best therapy and i have to agree, between us, i also find knitting very relaxing. Currently i'm looking forward to draw and paint again in the near future, and i'm very hopeful about it! </p>
